    <h1>AMULYA</h1>
    <h3>KERALA</h3>
    <P>Kerala, a kaleidoscope of mesmeric charms enthralls everyone with the sun, <b>the filtered glades of palm trees</b>, shimmering beaches, dense tropical forests, <b>rocky coasts</b>, still bays and astounding rivers. It has an intricate maze of mossy backwaters, interspersed with rice fields, rich in wildlife and bursting with cashew, coconut, coffee and rubber plantations, and a medley of spices such as cardamom, pepper, turmeric and ginger. Banana is intrinsic to the culture of Kerala; consumed as food and medicine, used in rituals and ceremonies and offered to gods in prayer. Tea plantations flourish in the highlands e.g. Munnar.</P>
